Clone the application from Giturl

Dcoker:

Write a dockerfile to conver as image--> check the dockerfile in structure
write docker-compose.yaml to run as service using docker compose up and down

BashScripting:

build.sh--> build dockerimage
deploy.sh-->deploy the application pull image from dockerhub repo

Dockerhub:

create repo for image storing 
naveenknavee/dev--> public repo
naveenknavee/prod-->private repo

Jenkins:

Allow port 22 and 8080 in SG

lanuch EC2 serve t2.medium 
install jdk 17,jenkins,docker....
Add jenkins to sudo group ,add docker to jenkins group

Restart jenkins and docker 

Webhook: pass the pay load url ip address to webhook in git repo for auto trigger

Credentials: pass the dockerhub username and pswd and mention the ID (important)
Pass the id to jenkinsfile

              Please find the step of all operation & logic in jenkins file 

• If code pushed to dev branch, docker image must build and pushed to dev repo in docker hub
• If dev merged to master, then docker image must be pushed to prod repo in docker hub

Create a multibranch pipeline -->it scan for jenkins file if file found it trigger the pipeline and 
execute the steps

git merge --> dev to master --> jenkins file found it deploy the application to production server 

Launch the t2.micro instance and configure SG

allow port 22
port 3000 for access the application install docker 
please find the screnshort of all the rules

Please find the monitoring.txt for full monitoring setup 

Monitoring:
